        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is an easy grilled peach dessert! I use a honey nut flavored cream cheese spread and it's wonderful! Drizzle a little extra honey after they're grilled and they're perfect!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 peaches, halved and pitted</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons clover honey</li>
            <li>1 cup soft cream cheese with honey and nuts</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
            <p>Preheat a grill for medium-high heat.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
            <p>Brush peaches with a light coating of oil. Place pit side down onto the grill. Grill for 5 minutes, or until the surfaces have nice grill marks. Turn the peaches over, and drizzle with a bit of honey. Place a dollop of the cream cheese spread in the place where the pit was. Grill for 2 to 3 more minutes, or until the filling is warm. Serve immediately.</p>
